Model randomization randomly assigns new models to characters, placeables, and doors, changing how they appear in-game.

The left-most checkboxes disable and enable categories.

> Character Models include all of the NPCs and MOBs (.utc) that are not spawned by template (such as party members, the player, and a few odd creatures). 
Omit Large Models prevents characters from being randomized to some of the huge models, such as Krayt Dragon or Rancor.
Omit Broken Models prevents characters from being randomized to entirely invisible or testing models.

> Placeable Models include all placeable objects (.utp) such as footlockers, computer consoles, or marker-posts.
Omit Large models prevents placeables from being randomized to some of the huge models, such as the invisible acid wall or some land-speeders.
Omit Broken models prevents placeables from being randomized to entirely invisible or testing models.
	> Door Models include all door objects (.utd) such as regular doors, force-fields, and even sith sarcophagi.
Omit Airlocks prevents the airlocks in Hrakert Station from being overwritten, which can sometimes cause them not to function.
Omit Broken Models prevents doors from being randomized to entirely invisible or testing models.

WARNING:
There is potential for softlocks in the event that a model that just isn't quite the right size prevents the player from moving to a location or from looting an important object. Use with care.
