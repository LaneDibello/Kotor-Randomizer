	- devise a better preset saving system
	- Actually Make it randomize things
	- look into crafting a fixed mission undercity script
	- Consider Switching Name Gen to space breaks
	- consider name gen presets
	- Deal with empty BoundModules possibility
	- Finish KRP Write
	- Add KRP Read
	- Update KRP stuff when TwoDA and TExt Are done
