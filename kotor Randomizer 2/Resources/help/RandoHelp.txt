Once your presets have been selected you can select the 'Randomize' button to begin the randomization process. A progress bar will show the process as it goes along. When it is complete you can select 'Close' and continue to your game whenever you're ready.
	Undrandomizaing is a similar process. The program will detect if your game is currently randomized (Note this process isn't perfect, and if something seriously went wrong you may have to manually unrandomize your game, a process Lane can help you with). If the program believes your game is randomized you will receieve the unrandomize option. When clicking it a similar progress bar will appear and return the game back to its default state.
