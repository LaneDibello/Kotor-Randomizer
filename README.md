The much anticipated sequel to the original Kotor Randomizer. This program allows for the randomization of various different elements of Bioware’s Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.

## Features
**Module Randomization**
* Select which modules (levels) will be shuffled together. This changes the location that different load zones/module transitions take you to.
* Select which fixes and qol of life features you’d like implemented. This includes various patches that prevent softlocks, game crashes, and unreachable locations.
* Rule-Based Exclusions. Ensures certain module replacement rules are not violated, giving a nicer randomization without trapped zones.
* Reachability Verification. Sets the parameters for some simple digraph math, that will help assure the shuffle is beatable.
---
**Item Randomization**
* Toggle which item categories will be randomized. All items included in these categories will be shuffled around and will replace one another. 
* Choose your level of randomization. Allows the user to select if these item categories (and their sub-categories) will be mixed together or not.
* Select which items get omitted from this whole process.
---
**Music and Sound Randomization**
* Toggle which music and sound categories will be randomized. The sound files for these categories will be shuffled around and will replace one another.
*  Choose your level of randomization. Allows the user to select if these categories (and their sub-categories) will be mixed together or not.

**Presets and Seeding**
* Save your wild randomizer settings to a file that can be pulled up later.
