The SWKOTOR Path is the path of your game's swkotor folder. This folder contains all the data we need to adjust for randomization to occur.

Paths are usually detected automatically, however if this process does not work you will have to enter the path manually. If you are using Steam, finding this path is as simple as opening your library, right-clicking on the game, selecting properties, Local Files, and then Browse local files. From there, simply copy the path from the Address bar in file explorer, and paste it into the text box in the Path Form.
	There is a disabled option for the Kotor II path. This is one of the few controls keeping the hope of one day implementing K2 randomization alive. However, I haven't yet recieved the burst of motivation to required to undertake this task.
