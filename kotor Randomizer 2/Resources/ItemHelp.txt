Item randomization randomizes the template items in the game's key data. This means that items that are hard coded to the module will not be randomized. Which is beneifcial for most plot items.

Each category can be enabled or disabled by checkbox. The radio buttons cauuse each category to be randomized at different levels. Everything with the 'max' option selected will be shuffled together. Each category with 'type' option selected will only shuffle within itself. Each catagory with the 'Subtype' option selected will shuffle amoung that categories sub-categories.

All items selected on the 'Omitted' list will not be shuffled it, and will remain in their vanilla location and form. This list is populated by the Item resource Reference Codes, which can be found in the cheat section on the Stregy wiki under 'Giveitem'.
	I will briefly describe each category:
> Armor includes all items that go in the center equipment slot. The subtypes include different armor classes, robes, and clothes
