Text randomization can randomize some or most of the text appearing in the game. In its current state it has two main settings: Dialogue randomization and Additional Text Randomization. Dialogue randomization allows you to shuffle the entries (words spoken by NPCs), replies (options given to the MC), and match the entry sounds to the shuffled entries (So the new dialogue matches its text). 

This process is not yet foolproof. The “TalkTable” file being used for these randomizations doesn't always accurately match up the sound for a voice line and the text. This is BioWare’s fault and not ours, and it will require a bit more work for this matching to be 100% effective. For similar reasons sometimes a sound won’t exist and an NPC will “fast text” a line or two.
