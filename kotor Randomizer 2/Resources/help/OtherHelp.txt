Currently the 'Other' category holds randomization options that don't quite fit into any other category.

Name Generator Rando generates and replaces the letter-combo-probabiliy files used when generating random names in-game. By seeding Line break separated text the program will generate a file that can create new names based on the text provided.
	Random Pazaak Decks randomizes the cards possessed by the NPC Pazaak players beyond simply swapping around existing cards.

Other Various Rando options coming in the future, hopefully!
