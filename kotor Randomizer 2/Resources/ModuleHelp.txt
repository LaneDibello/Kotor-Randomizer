Module randomization essentially randomizes the locations of 'levels' or 'maps' in the game.

Randomized - This list box contains the resource reference codes for all of the modules that will be randomized by the program when executed. You can find the equivalent location names for these codes on the strategy wiki cheat page under 'Warp'.

Omitted - This list box contains the resource reference codes for all of the modules that will not be randomized. Double clicking, or pressing return will transfer any module to the opposite list box.

Presets - This combo box contains the hard coded presets for module randomization.

Delete Module Save Data - This is enabled by default in the base game. Unchecking this will prevent the game of clearing the save file of presumably "unreachable" modules, such as Taris when reaching Dantooine, or the mid game when reaching Lehon. Disabling this can help prevent progress loss.
	Include Minigames in Save - This feature makes the game commit the minigame module data to teh save when entering them, preventing possible game scrashes with randomized swoops or turrets.

Include All Modules in Save - This feature extends the previous one to also include STUNT cutscenes and various other odd modules.

Fixed Dream Sequence - Fixes a rare instance in which a game crash could occur with dream sequences.

Unlocked Galaxy Map - Unlockes all planets and location of the Ebon Hawk Galaxy map from the start, converting it from a common softlock to a useful tool.

Fixed Module Coordinates - A quality of life fix that deals with some unfortunate spawn locations in specific modules.

Fixed Mind Prison - Allows the mind prison to occur multiple times.
