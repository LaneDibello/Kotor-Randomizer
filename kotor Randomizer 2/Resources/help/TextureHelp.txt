Texture randomization will shuffle most of the images stored in the selected texture pack making the game appear as a freaky hell-scape.

WARNING:
Texture randomization frequently results in visual experiences that may prove harmful to photosensitive users. Use with caution.

NOTE: This randomization does not edit with GUI textures, only those used in 3D environments.

Each category can be enabled or disabled by checkbox. The radio buttons cause each category to be randomized at different levels. Everything with the 'Max' option selected will be shuffled together. Each category with 'Type' option selected will only shuffle within itself.

The 'Texture Packs' refer the the three quality settings (low, medium, and high) avaiable in the game's graphical settings. This allows you to select which pack is being randomized, which also provides an escape from the textures by switching to another pack.
